<p>
    If you are looking at this page, I must assume you are trying to get
    started with Front-End Web Development. Well done old chap/lass, well done!
</p>
<p>
    The following tutorials should be able to get you fully acquainted with
    the basics of Front-End. These courses cover HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Wordpress.
</p>

<p>
    Take your time with these, do them more than once. It's really important
    to get a strong grasp of the fundamentals and best-practices so that you
    can move on to bigger and better tutorials/projects.

<h3>1. Learn the HTML/CSS/JavaScript Basics on Code Academy </h3>
<p>
    Known for being one of the best coding tutorial sites for beginners,
    Code Academy is the best resouce to get started. They've created a
    cool in-browser code editor, so you don't have to worry about your
    tooling or setup. They also make it really simple to just hop into the
    code and learn the fundamentals. Focus more on the HTML/CSS courses,
    as they are smaller programming languages, and therefore easier to
    learn. There will be an amazing course on modern JS in an upcoming
    series.

<h3>2. Get your Javascript chops from Wes Bos </h3>
<p>
    Wes Bos is one of the best web development instructors I have
    encountered in my 6+ years of coding. I have purchased every one of
    his courses, and they have all been very informative. He is a total
    Javascript pro, and his free JS30 courses does an amazing job of
    opening your eyes to the possibilites of JS (seriously, they're
    endless). This course will not teach you everything there is to know
    about JS, but it will definitley give you a solid foundation to start
    from.

<h3>3. Get your Wordpress on with Brad Hussey</h3>
<p>
    I had been working with Wordpress for a few months before I stumbled
    upon Brad Hussey Wordpress course. Previous to that, a client would
    show me a website design they liked, I would BUY a theme from
    <a href="https://themeforest.net/">Themeforest.net</a>, and then I
    would make as many CSS changes as I could to get close to the original
    site's design. I was so wrong for doing that!!!!
</p>

<p>
    Brad's course not only taught me how to develop themes from scratch,
    but it also showed me how to use popular CSS/JS code libraries like
    Bootstrap to create mobile-friendly websites in a short period of
    time. This is the only paid course on this list, but it should not
    cost more than $40, as UDemy.com gives away coupons like crazy.

<h3>4. Step into the future of CSS via CSS Grid</h3>
<p>
    When I started coding, I would use Bootstrap in all of my projects. Even if I was only using the grid, I would include the entire Bootstrap library in my project because it seemed to be an easy way to make my websites responsive. Recently I've been playing with CSS Grid (which is now supported by all browsers), and have not been disappointed.
</p>

<p>
   Per Harald Borgen's course is a really quick set of videos that will get you up and running with CSS Grid in no time.
